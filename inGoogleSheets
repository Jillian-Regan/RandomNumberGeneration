=RANDBETWEEN(lowest number, highest number)
OR
=RANDBETWEEN (lowest cell in same column, highest cell in same column)

*if want random number between 0 and 1,then use =RAND() instead of =RANDBETWEEN()*

**Remember that it will keep generating random numbers, so once generated, copy and paste the random number(s) 
into a new cell or column as values only so those numbers will be saved and not continue to change.**
