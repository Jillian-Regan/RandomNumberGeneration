=RANDBETWEEN (lowest number, highest number)
OR
=RANDBETWEEN (cell in column with lowest number, cell in colomn with highest number)

*Or if want random numbers between 0 and 1, then use =RAND instead of =RANDBETWEEN*

*Don't forget that it will keep generating different random numbers, so copy and paste the cell or column 
into a new cell column pasting values only**
